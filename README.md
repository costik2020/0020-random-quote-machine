# 0020-random-quote-machine


I did this project as part of Front End Development Libraries Certification from freeCodeCamp coding bootcamp.

It is a fun little project that **makes API requests for quotes** and shows a new and interesting quote.

I used Quotable, a free and open source API, repository address: 
https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote
Special thanks to: lukePeavey for making this possible, for making this API and share it with the DEV comunity..


This project was done with this technologies:
- jQuery 
- Bootstrap 
- fontawesome icons 
- And a little bit of HTML, css, JavaScript
